# Database Starter Project 

## Getting Started

- Clone this repo 
- Install the dependencies -  `npm install`
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env`. 
- **If you are using Atlas**, to host your DB you will need to update the `MONGODB_URI=<your database url>`. You should place `/wine` at the end of your connection url (e.g., `mongodb+srv://test:<password>@cluster0.x08wt.mongodb.net/wine?retryWrites=true&w=majority`)





- If this is your first time getting started then run the seeder - `node seeder`
- Run the project in development mode - `npm run dev`
